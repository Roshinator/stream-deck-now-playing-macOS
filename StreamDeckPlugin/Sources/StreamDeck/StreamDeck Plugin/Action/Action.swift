	/// If your action does not use settings, simply use `NoSettings`.

	/// The name of the action. This string is visible to the user in the actions list.
	static var name: String { get }
	
	/// The unique identifier of the action.
	///
	/// It must be a uniform type identifier (UTI) that contains only lowercase alphanumeric characters (a-z, 0-9), hyphen (-), and period (.).
	///
	/// The string must be in reverse-DNS format.
	///
	/// For example, if your domain is elgato.com and you create a plugin named Hello with the action My Action, you could assign the string com.elgato.hello.myaction as your action's Unique Identifier.

	/// The relative path to a PNG image without the .png extension.
	///
	/// This image is displayed in the actions list. The PNG image should be a 20pt x 20pt image. You should provide @1x and @2x versions of the image.
	/// The Stream Deck application take care of loaded the appropriate version of the image.

	///
	/// Each action can have one state or 2 states (on/off).
	///
	/// For example the Hotkey action has a single state. However the Game Capture Record action has 2 states, active and inactive.
	///
	/// The state of an action, supporting multiple states, is always automatically toggled whenever the action's key is released (after being pressed).
	///
	/// In addition, it is possible to force the action to switch its state by sending a `setState` event.
	///
	/// - Note: If no states are specified the manifest will generate a single state using the `Action`'s icon.

	///
	/// The relative path to the Property Inspector html file if your plugin want to display some custom settings in the Property Inspector.

	/// Boolean to prevent the action from being used in a Multi Action.
	///
	/// True by default.

	/// The string displayed as tooltip when the user leaves the mouse over your action in the actions list.
	static var tooltip: String? { get }
	
	/// Boolean to hide the action in the actions list.
	///
	/// This can be used for plugin that only works with a specific profile. True by default.

	/// When an instance of an action is displayed on the Stream Deck, for example when the hardware is first plugged in, or when a folder containing that action is entered, the plugin will receive a `willAppear` event.

	/// You will see such an event when:
	/// - the Stream Deck application is started
	/// - the user switches between profiles
	/// - the user sets a key to use your action
	/// - Parameters:
	///   - device: An opaque value identifying the device.
	///   - payload: The event payload sent by the server.
	func willAppear(device: String, payload: AppearEvent<Settings>)
	
	/// When an instance of an action ceases to be displayed on Stream Deck, for example when switching profiles or folders, the plugin will receive a `willDisappear` event.
	///
	/// You will see such an event when:
	/// - the user switches between profiles
	/// - the user deletes an action
	/// - Parameters:
	///   - device: An opaque value identifying the device.
	///   - payload: The event payload sent by the server.
	func willDisappear(device: String, payload: AppearEvent<Settings>)
	
	/// When the user presses a key, the plugin will receive the `keyDown` event.
	/// - Parameters:
	///   - device: An opaque value identifying the device.
	///   - payload: The event payload sent by the server.
	func keyDown(device: String, payload: KeyEvent<Settings>)
	
	/// When the user releases a key, the plugin will receive the `keyUp` event.
	/// - Parameters:
	///   - device: An opaque value identifying the device.
	///   - payload: The event payload sent by the server.

	/// When the user changes the title or title parameters of the instance of an action, the plugin will receive a `titleParametersDidChange` event.

	/// - Parameters:
	///   - device: An opaque value identifying the device.
